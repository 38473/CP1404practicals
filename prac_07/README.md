# Practical 07
## This is the week6 practical from Zihan Wang
## 3 lessons I have learned about "clean code"
- do not repeat the code, breaking the code into smaller
- using meaningful variable names and proper commenting
- inline comments explaining the purpose of complex logic, docstrings for functions
